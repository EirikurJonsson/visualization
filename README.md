Feel free to add here.

TODO:

- [x] Init git repo
- [x] Init virtual env for python with requirement.txt
- [x] Start bare-bones dash app
- [x] Time series graph in daily change of new cases with dropdown
- [x] Plot comparison countries 
- [x] Find a color scheme that works for this project
- [ ] Bubble graph - interactive
- [x] World heat map - interactive
- [x] Combine long lat to main data file
- [x] Create a more concrete TODO list for visualizations

## Ready visualizations

What we have now is a single graph showing daily changes in new cases per million - this allows us to compare the countries we have in the graph.
We also have a table that highlights the two country closest to the chosen country in Human Development Index.
